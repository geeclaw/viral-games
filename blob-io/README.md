# BLOB CONQUEST - IO Territory Game

## Concept
An IO-style territorial control game where you control a blob that leaves a glowing trail. Draw loops to capture territory. Cut enemy trails to eliminate them. Dominate the arena!

## Why It Will Go Viral

### 1. Territory Control Addiction
- Filling the map with your color is deeply satisfying
- Risk vs reward: more territory = more points but bigger target
- Every game is different (procedural AI behavior)

### 2. Competitive Streaming
- Perfect for Twitch/YouTube gameplay
- "Clippable" moments when you barely escape
- 1v1 battles are intense
- Team modes could be added later

### 3. Paper.io + Snake.io Magic
- Combines two proven IO game formulas
- Novel tail-cutting mechanic adds aggression
- Strategic depth (when to attack vs farm territory)

### 4. Social Multiplayer
- Fun with friends
- Enemies feel personal (you can see them)
- "I killed that guy" satisfaction
