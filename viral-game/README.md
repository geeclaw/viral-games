# TARGET SWAP - Chaotic Party Game

## Concept
A 3D chaotic party game where 2-4 players compete to catch their assigned targets, but targets randomly swap mid-game. The chaos moment: you think you're chasing player A, suddenly you're chasing player B who was just chasing you!

## Why It Will Go Viral

### 1. "Friendslop" Energy
